- ForC and GROA comparison.csv- File comparing the papers within GROA to the papers in ForCdb. [File is old version/ not comprehensive](https://github.com/forc-db/GROA/issues/21#issuecomment-634364764).

- soiltosurface.csv - if I am remembering correctly, we generated the soiltosurface.csv to be consistent with ForCdb. (See [issue #22](https://github.com/forc-db/GROA/issues/22#issuecomment-634364210)).
