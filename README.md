# Global Reforestation Opportunity Assessment (GROA)

These data were assembled by the Nature Conservancy and a team of scientists from 19 institutions to quantify carbon sequestration in naturally regenerating forests around the world. This analysis was published in *Nature* in 2020 (Cook-Patton et al. 2020). 

We encourage the research community to collaborate in updating, correcting, expanding, and utilizing this database through the ForC platform. 


## Data Use Policy and Guidelines

offers of co-authorship on publications drawing heavily upon ForC would be appreciated. 

### License

GROA is licensed under [CC-BY-4](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), as described in [`license.txt`](https://github.com/forc-db/GROA/blob/master/license.txt).

### Communication/ collaboration with GROA team

While not required, we encourage researchers planning to use GROA to contact the principal investigator (Dr. Susan Cook-Patton, The Nature Conservancy) to inform her of intended use of the data and to discuss potential collaboration. 

### Database citation
Any publications using these data should cite Cook-Patton et al. 2020. In addition, this database should be referenced as well (DOI representing all versions: [10.5281/zenodo.1135088](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1187192)). If the data has changed since original publication, arising publications should cite the specific version used, ideally with a DOI associated with that version. Authors may contact Susan Cook-Patton (The Nature Conservancy) or Kristina Anderson-Teixeira (Smithsonian) to generate a release and associated DOI that matches the database version used.
